roblem 1: Hunny Hunt
Write a function linear_search() to help Winnie the Pooh locate his lost items. The function accepts a list items and a target value as parameters. The function should return the first index of target in items, and -1 if target is not in the lst. Do not use any built-in functions.

def linear_search(lst, target):
	pass
Example Usage:

items = ['haycorn', 'haycorn', 'haycorn', 'hunny', 'haycorn']
target = 'hunny'
linear_search(items, target)

items = ['bed', 'blue jacket', 'red shirt', 'hunny']
target = 'red balloon'
linear_search(items, target)
Example Output:

3
-1

Problem 2: Bouncy, Flouncy, Trouncy, Pouncy
Tigger has developed a new programming language Tiger with only four operations and one variable tigger.

bouncy and flouncy both increment the value of the variable tigger by 1.
trouncy and pouncy both decrement the value of the variable tigger by 1.
Initially, the value of tigger is 1 because he's the only tigger around! Given a list of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of tigger after performing all the operations.

def final_value_after_operations(operations):
	pass
Example Usage:

operations = ["trouncy", "flouncy", "flouncy"]
final_value_after_operations(operations)

operations = ["bouncy", "bouncy", "flouncy"]
final_value_after_operations(operations)
Example Output:

2
4

Problem 3: T-I-Double Guh-Er II
T-I-Double Guh-Er: That spells Tigger! Write a function tiggerfy() that accepts a string word and returns a new string that removes any substrings t, i, gg, and er from word. The function should be case insensitive.

def tiggerfy(word):
	pass
Example Usage:

word = "Trigger"
tiggerfy(word)

word = "eggplant"
tiggerfy(word)

word = "Choir"
tiggerfy(word)
Example Output:

"r"
"eplan"
"Chor"

Problem 4: Non-decreasing Array
Given an array nums with n integers, write a function non_decreasing() that checks if nums could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array is non-decreasing if nums[i] <= nums[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= n - 2).

def non_decreasing(nums):
	pass
Example Usage:

nums = [4, 2, 3]
non_decreasing(nums)

nums = [4, 2, 1]
non_decreasing(nums)
Example Output:

True
False

Problem 5: Missing Clues
Christopher Robin set up a scavenger hunt for Pooh, but it's a blustery day and several hidden clues have blown away. Write a function find_missing_clues() to help Christopher Robin figure out which clues he needs to remake. The function accepts two integers lower and upper and a unique integer array clues. All elements in clues are within the inclusive range [lower, upper].

A clue x is considered missing if x is in the range [lower, upper] and x is not in clues.

Return the shortest sorted list of ranges that exactly covers all the missing numbers. That is, no element of clues is included in any of the ranges, and each missing number is covered by one of the ranges.

def find_missing_clues(clues, lower, upper):
   pass
Example Usage:

clues = [0, 1, 3, 50, 75]
lower = 0
upper = 99
find_missing_clues(clues, lower, upper)

clues = [-1]
lower = -1
upper = -1
find_missing_clues(clues, lower, upper)
Example Output:

[[2, 2], [4, 49], [51, 74], [76, 99]]
[]

Problem 6: Vegetable Harvest
Rabbit is collecting carrots from his garden to make a feast for Pooh and friends. Write a function harvest() that accepts a 2D n x m matrix vegetable_patch and returns the number of of carrots that are ready to harvest in the vegetable patch. A carrot is ready to harvest if vegetable_patch[i][j] has value 'c'.

Assume n = len(vegetable_patch) and m = len(vegetable_patch[0]). 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < m.

def harvest(vegetable_patch):
	pass
Example Usage:

vegetable_patch = [
	['x', 'c', 'x'],
	['x', 'x', 'x'],
	['x', 'c', 'c'],
	['c', 'c', 'c']
]
harvest(vegetable_patch)
Example Output:

Problem 7: Eeyore's House
Eeyore has collected two piles of sticks to rebuild his house and needs to choose pairs of sticks whose lengths are the right proportion. Write a function good_pairs() that accepts two integer arrays pile1 and pile2 where each integer represents the length of a stick. The function also accepts a positive integer k. The function should return the number of good pairs.

A pair (i, j) is called good if pile1[i] is divisible by pile2[j] * k. Assume 0 <= i <= len(pile1) - 1 and 0 <= j <= len(pile2) - 1.

def good_pairs(pile1, pile2, k):
	pass
Example Usage:

pile1 = [1, 3, 4]
pile2 = [1, 3, 4]
k = 1
good_pairs(pile1, pile2, k)

pile1 = [1, 2, 4, 12]
pile2 = [2, 4]
k = 3
good_pairs(pile1, pile2, k)
Example Output:

Problem 8: Local Maximums
Write a function local_maximums() that accepts an n x n integer matrix grid and returns an integer matrix local_maxes of size (n - 2) x (n - 2) such that:

local_maxes[i][j] is equal to the largest value of the 3 x 3 matrix in grid centered around row i + 1 and column j + 1.
In other words, we want to find the largest value in every contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.
