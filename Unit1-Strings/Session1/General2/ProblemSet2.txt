def up_and_down(lst):
	pass
Example Usage

lst = [1, 2, 3]
up_and_down(lst)

lst = [1, 3, 5]

Problem 11: Running Sum
Write a function running_sum() that accepts a list of integers superhero_stats representing the number of crimes Batman has stopped each month in Gotham City. The function should modify the list to return the running sum such that superhero_stats[i] = sum(superhero_stats[0]...superhero_stats[i]). You must modify the list in place; you may not create any new lists as part of your solution.

def running_sum(superhero_stats):
	pass
Example Usage

superhero_stats = [1, 2, 3, 4]
running_sum(superhero_stats)

superhero_stats = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
running_sum(superhero_stats)

superhero_stats = [3, 1, 2, 10, 1]
running_sum(superhero_stats)
Example Output:

	pass
Example Usage

cards = ['Joker', 'Queen', 2, 3, 'Ace', 7]
shuffle(cards)

cards = [9, 2, 3, 'Joker', 'Joker', 3, 2, 9]
shuffle(cards)

cards = [10, 10, 2, 2]
shuffle(cards)
Example Output:

['Joker', 3, 'Queen', 'Ace', 2, 7]
