# Problem 2: Croquembouche
# You are designing a delicious croquembouche (a French dessert composed of a cone-shaped tower of cream puffs ðŸ˜‹), 
# for a couple's wedding. They want the cream puffs to have a variety of flavors. You've finished your design and want to
# send it to the couple for review.

# Given a root of a binary tree design where each node in the tree represents a cream puff in the croquembouche
# , that prints a list of the flavors (vals) of each cream puff in level order (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

# Note: The build_tree() and print_tree() functions both use variations of a level order traversal.
# To get the most out of this problem, we recommend that you reference these functions as little as possible
# while implementing your solution.

# Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale
# for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced
# when calculating time complexity.
