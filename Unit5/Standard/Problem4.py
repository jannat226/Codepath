# Problem 4: Set Character
#
class Villager:
    ''' In the previous exercise, we accessed and modified a playerâ€™s catchphrase attribute directly.
    Instead of allowing users to update their player directly, it is common to create setter methods
    that users can call to update class attributes. 
    This has a few different benefits, including allowing us to validate data before updating our class instance.

    # Update your Villager class with a method set_catchphrase() that takes in one parameter new_catchphrase.

    # If new_catchphrase is valid, it should update the villager's catchphrase attribute to have value
    # new_catchphrase and print "Catchphrase updated".
    # Otherwise, it should print out "Invalid catchphrase".
    # Valid catchphrases are less than 20 characters in length. They must all contain only alphabetic and
    # whitespace characters.

    def __init__(self, name, species, catchphrase):
        self.name = name
        self.species = species
        self.catchphrase = catchphrase
        self.furniture = []

    def set_catchphrase(self, new_catchphrase):

        if len(new_catchphrase)  < 20 : 
            for char in new_catchphrase:
                if char.isalpha() or char == " ":

# Example Usage:

alice = Villager("Alice", "Koala", "guvnor")

alice.set_catchphrase("sweet dreams")
print(alice.catchphrase)
alice.set_catchphrase("#?!")
print(alice.catchphrase)
# Example Output:

# Example 1:
# Catchphrase Updated!
# sweet dreams
# Invalid catchphrase
# sweet dreams
